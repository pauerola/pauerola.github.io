## Welcome!

Welcome to my (weak attempt to have a) webpage! I am a researcher in bioinformat
ics and complex systems. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from [Unive
rsitat Rovira i Virgili](http://www.urv.cat) and a M.Sc. in Biomedicine from [Un
iversitat de Barcelona](http://www.ub.edu), both in 2016.
Currently I am working at the [Roslin Institute](http://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin) in 
[Tom Michoel group](http://lab.michoel.info). For more information on my work ch
eck out my [ :books: publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&us
