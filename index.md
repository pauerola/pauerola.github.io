## Welcome!

Welcome to my (weak attempt to have a) webpage! I am a researcher in computational systems biology, bioinformatics and complex systems. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from [Universitat Rovira i Virgili](http://www.urv.cat) and a M.Sc. in Biomedicine from [Universitat de Barcelona](http://www.ub.edu), both in 2016.

Currently I am working at the [Roslin Institute](http://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin) in [Tom Michoel group](http://lab.michoel.info). For more information about my work, please check out my [ :books: publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Q8tjPdMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), [ :pencil: preprints](http://arxiv.org/a/erola_p_1) and [ :octocat: git repository](http://github.com/pauerola).
